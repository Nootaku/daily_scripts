# About daily_scripts

This is a collection of scripts that I use on a regular basis. I think they can help other people develop them a little faster. So feel free to use them.<br>However, please be fair. Don't take the credit - I trust you.

Inside each `.sh` file you will find what the script does, how to use it, the required dependencies and some documentation.

The following paragraphs are just extra information about each script.

## mongo
The mongo file contains scripts to quickly install and uninstall mongo on Ubuntu.

## conda
`newConda.sh` is a script that creates a new conda venv since I always forgot how to make one.

## VPN
`startVPN.sh` is under construction. This scripts automates launching an OpenVPN instance with ProtonMail credentials.
